This repository aims to simplify the set up of a basic STEM lab using free and open source software (FOSS) on simple hardware, with some scripts and advice aimed at simplifying the setup for educators or volunteers.

The aim of this project is to allow schools to create computer labs that

1) are inexpensive (old or discarded pentium or better hardware with at least 1GB RAM is typically adequate)

2) do not require always on internet connections to work

3) are not a corporate vehicle for marketing hardware and software solutions to educators and future consumers

4) allow coding, simulation, modelling, animation, graphic design, CAD/CAM, PCB design and game development

To this end, the lubuntu linux distribution has been selected, owing to

1) its ability to run on lower end hardware thanks to its lightweight desktop windowing environment

2) is ability to leverage the debian/ubuntu software ecosystem

3) the excellent support available for debian/ubuntu derivative operating systems
