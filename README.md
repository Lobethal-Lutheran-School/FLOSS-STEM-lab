This repository aims to simplify the set up of a basic STEM lab using free, libre and open source software (FLOSS) on simple hardware, with some scripts and advice aimed at simplifying the setup for educators or volunteers.

The aim of this project is to allow K-12 schools and education environments to create computer labs that

1) are inexpensive (old or discarded pentium or better hardware with at least 1GB RAM is typically adequate)

2) do not require always on internet connections to work

3) are not a corporate vehicle for marketing hardware and software solutions to educators and future consumers

4) allow coding, simulation, modelling, animation, graphic design, CAD/CAM, PCB design and game development

To this end, the lubuntu linux distribution has been selected, owing to

1) its ability to run on lower end hardware thanks to its lightweight desktop windowing environment

2) its ability to leverage the debian/ubuntu software ecosystem

3) the excellent support available for debian/ubuntu derivative operating systems

Key motivations are

1) allow students to code, create and explore with free, give away hardware and FLOSS software

2) allow a computer lab to work without cloud hosted content or software as a service

3) allow all of the above without the cost of always on internet

4) allow all of the above without concerns about filtering of internet content
